The client wants a codebase that follows accessibility standards as it is an increasingly important part of their business. It is to ensure that people with disabilitoes can get access to the website using assistive technologies. Furthermore, making the website accessible will make the client better positioned in search engines like Google.


The goal is to provide the customer with a high standard webpage so that people with disabilities can access their website . 


With many disabled people all over the world, providing the client with a high standard website and making it acessible is imperative.

The challenge is to refactor the existing website to make it more accessible.
